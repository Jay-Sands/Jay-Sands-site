**Progress Summary as of November 21, 2025**

### Current Issues:
1. **Slow Page Load Times on Mobile**:
   - Root cause not yet identified.
   - Suggested debugging using Chrome Developer Tools to simulate mobile network conditions.

2. **Hamburger Menu Not Visible/Functional**:
   - Structure added to multiple pages (`index.html`, `shows.html`, `booking.html`, `feedback.html`, `home.html`).
   - JavaScript (`hamburger.js`) linked to handle toggle functionality.
   - CSS updated for `.hamburger-menu` and `.mobile-nav`.
   - Still not functioning as expected.

### Completed Tasks:
- Added hamburger menu structure to relevant pages.
- Linked `hamburger.js` and `style.css` to all necessary files.
- Updated CSS for mobile navigation.

### Pending Tasks:
1. Debug and fix slow page load times.
2. Ensure hamburger menu is visible and functional across all pages.
3. Conduct a deep dive into mobile performance issues.

### Next Steps:
- Analyze network performance to identify slow-loading resources.
- Debug JavaScript and CSS for hamburger menu functionality.
- Optionally, test directly on a mobile device for further insights.
