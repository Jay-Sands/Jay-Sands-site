Jay Sands Site - Shows.html Issue Log

Date: November 13, 2025

Summary:
- User and Copilot confirmed editing the correct file: c:\jay-sands-site-test\shows.html
- 'TEST' banner added for troubleshooting; it appears in browser, confirming Live Server is serving the file.
- Other page content (show list, layout) did not update or display as expected.
- CSS comment error was fixed; file is now clean and error-free.
- User is pausing work for now; issue remains unresolved.

Next Steps:
- Remove 'TEST' banner when resuming.
- Continue troubleshooting why show list and layout do not display correctly.
- Check browser console for errors and verify external resources (style.css, fonts).

This note is for resuming work quickly next session.
