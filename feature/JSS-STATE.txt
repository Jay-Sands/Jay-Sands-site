JSS Project State - Last Saved

- Main site folder: C:\Users\jsang\OneDrive\Desktop\Jay-Sands-site\feature
- All live site work should be done in this folder.
- A backup of the full JSS folder exists.
- Netlify publish directory is set to . (root), and the site is working.
- Ready to clean up extra folders, but backup is available if needed.
- Todo: Continue cleanup and keep all work in the feature folder.

When you return, just mention this file (JSS-STATE.txt) and I will pick up from here!
