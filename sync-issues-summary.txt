# Sync Issues Summary

## Date: November 17, 2025

### Problem:
The live site is not reflecting the updated files from the `jay-sands-site-test` directory, even after synchronizing with the `Jay-Sands-site/feature` directory and pushing the changes to the remote repository.

### Actions Taken:
1. **Synchronized Directories**:
   - Used `robocopy` to ensure `jay-sands-site-test` and `Jay-Sands-site/feature` directories are identical.
   - Verified synchronization with a dry-run (`/L`) to confirm no differences.

2. **Committed and Pushed Changes**:
   - Staged all changes using `git add -A`.
   - Committed the synchronization with the message: "Synchronize jay-sands-site-test with Jay-Sands-site/feature".
   - Pushed the changes to the remote `main` branch.

3. **Verified Remote Repository**:
   - Confirmed the latest commit (`5d45fa3`) is present on the remote `main` branch.

### Outstanding Issues:
- The live site still displays outdated files, indicating a deployment or caching issue.

### Next Steps:
1. **Check Deployment Platform**:
   - Verify if the deployment platform (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages) is using the `main` branch as the source.
   - Check deployment logs for errors.

2. **Clear Cache**:
   - Clear browser cache and force refresh the site.
   - Clear deployment platform cache if applicable.

3. **Manual Verification**:
   - Open key files on the live site and compare them with the local versions to identify discrepancies.

4. **Retry Deployment**:
   - Trigger a manual deployment from the deployment platform.

### Notes:
- This issue may require further investigation into the deployment process or platform-specific settings.
- All local changes are committed and pushed, so no further Git actions are needed at this time.
