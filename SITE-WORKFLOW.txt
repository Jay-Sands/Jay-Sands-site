Site Workflow Guidance

- Use jay-sands-site-test (JSStest) for testing, drafts, and experiments.
- Once changes are confirmed, copy or merge them into Jay-Sands-site/feature for production.
- Deploy from Jay-Sands-site/feature for the live site.

This keeps your production site stable and allows safe testing.
